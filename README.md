# Machine-Learning

These projects cover a wide range of machine learning techniques, including:

- Handling imbalanced datasets with resampling techniques.
- Exploring and preprocessing data for effective feature engineering.
- Applying classification and regression models with hyperparameter tuning.
- Using ensemble learning and stacking to combine model predictions for improved results.
- Evaluating models with appropriate metrics to ensure performance on both majority and minority classes.
- These concepts help tackle a variety of real-world problems, from churn prediction and customer satisfaction to fraud detection and house price prediction.
