# Machine Learning Projects Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning **Kaggle** projects addressing various real-world problems using classification, regression, and ensemble learning techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered:
1. **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Techniques like **SMOTE** to balance datasets and improve minority class predictions.
2. **EDA & Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, encoding, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for modeling.
3. **Classification & Regression Models**: Models like **Decision Trees**, **KNN**, **SVM**, **MLP**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting** are applied.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: **RandomizedSearchCV** and **GridSearchCV** used to optimize model performance.
5. **Ensemble Learning & Stacking**: Combining models for better predictions using **stacking** and **majority voting**.
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, **F1 score**, and **ROC-AUC** are used to ensure balanced performance.
