# House Price Prediction with Advanced Regression Techniques

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using a dataset with 79 explanatory variables that describe various aspects of the homes. It aims to explore how factors beyond basic features like the number of bedrooms or a picket fence influence price negotiations. The project involves experimenting with advanced regression techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble learning to build a robust predictive model.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Creative Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is an essential aspect of improving the predictive power of models. This project involves experimenting with different ways of transforming or combining the available features for better performance.

### 2. Advanced Regression Techniques
Techniques like **random forest** and **gradient boosting** are employed to model the dataset and predict house prices. These methods are well-suited for capturing complex relationships in the data.

### 3. Ensemble Learning
**One-layer stacking** is used to combine predictions from some of the better-performing algorithms. Models such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines are combined in the stacking layer for better predictions.
