# Imbalanced Data Handling with SMOTE and Ensemble Learning with Stacking

## Project Overview

This project aims to address imbalanced classification problems through the use of **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** and improve prediction accuracy using ensemble learning through **stacking**. The focus of the project is to experiment with different percentages of SMOTE to optimize predictions for minority classes. Additionally, the project implements stacking to combine predictions from different machine learning models, enhancing overall accuracy. The final goal is to apply these techniques to a Kaggle competition problem.

## Key Topics

### Imbalanced Data Handling with SMOTE

- **Imbalanced data problems** occur when one class (minority class) is underrepresented compared to others (majority class), which is common in real-world scenarios such as fraud detection.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** is used to generate synthetic examples of the minority class, helping to balance the dataset and improve model performance.
- The project will experiment with different percentages of SMOTE to achieve higher prediction accuracy, especially for the minority class.

### Ensemble Learning with Stacking

- **Ensemble learning** combines predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance.
- **Stacking** is an advanced ensemble method where predictions from different models are combined to create a new model, resulting in more accurate predictions.
- The project will use at least five different models (e.g., decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and K-nearest neighbors) and combine their predictions using one-layer stacking.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** will be performed on the stacked model to further optimize performance.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python (with libraries such as `sklearn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `vecstack`)
- Kaggle for data submission and competition participation
- Excel for recording and analyzing results

## Kaggle Competition

The Kaggle Homesite competition involves predicting the probability that a customer will purchase a quoted insurance plan (binary classification problem). The project will submit the stacked model's predictions to Kaggle, and results will be documented in an Excel table comparing performance metrics.
