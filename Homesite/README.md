This project aims to address imbalanced classification problems through the use of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and improve prediction accuracy using ensemble learning through stacking. The focus of the project will be to experiment with different percentages of SMOTE to optimize predictions for minority classes. Additionally, the project will implement stacking to combine predictions from different machine learning models to enhance overall accuracy. The final goal is to apply these techniques to a Kaggle competition problem.


Imbalanced Data Handling with SMOTE:

Imbalanced data problems occur when one class (minority class) is underrepresented compared to others (majority class), which is common in real-world scenarios such as fraud detection.
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to generate synthetic examples of the minority class, helping to balance the dataset and improve model performance.
The project will experiment with different percentages of SMOTE to achieve higher prediction accuracy, especially for the minority class.

Ensemble Learning with Stacking:

Ensemble learning is a technique where predictions from multiple models are combined to improve overall performance.
Stacking is an advanced ensemble method where predictions from different models are combined to create a new model, resulting in more accurate predictions.
The project will use at least five different models (e.g., decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and K-nearest neighbors) and combine their predictions using one-layer stacking.
Hyperparameter tuning will be performed on the stacked model to further optimize the performance.
