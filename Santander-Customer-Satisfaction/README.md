# Santander Customer Satisfaction Prediction

## Overview

The **Santander Customer Satisfaction** dataset presents a unique set of challenges for predictive modeling, primarily due to its **heavily imbalanced classes**, **high dimensionality**, and lack of explicit feature information. In this dataset, satisfied customers significantly outnumber unsatisfied ones (73,012 to 3,008), creating a risk of models being biased towards predicting satisfaction. This imbalance requires advanced resampling techniques like **SMOTE** and the use of more nuanced performance metrics such as **F1 score**, **precision-recall curves**, and **ROC-AUC scores**.

## Challenges

### Imbalanced Classes

- The dataset contains a **large class imbalance** with satisfied customers (majority class) far outnumbering unsatisfied customers (minority class).
- This imbalance can lead to models achieving high overall accuracy while failing to accurately predict the minority class (unsatisfied customers).
- To address this, **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** will be applied to balance the dataset, improving model performance on the minority class.

### High Dimensionality

- The **high dimensionality** of the dataset increases the risk of **overfitting** and makes the selection of relevant features challenging.
- Careful **feature selection** and **dimensionality reduction techniques** will be necessary to ensure the model can generalize effectively.

### Lack of Feature Information

- The dataset does not provide clear feature descriptions, making it difficult to apply domain knowledge for **feature engineering**.
- Automated techniques such as **feature importance ranking** and **PCA** may be explored to address this challenge.

## Project Approach

1. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: 
   - Apply **SMOTE** to oversample the minority class (unsatisfied customers) and balance the dataset.
   - Experiment with different oversampling ratios to optimize performance for identifying unsatisfied customers.

2. **Performance Metrics**: 
   - Use metrics such as **F1 score**, **precision-recall curves**, and **ROC-AUC** to evaluate the model, ensuring a focus on predicting the minority class accurately.

3. **Feature Selection**: 
   - Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to handle the high dimensionality and reduce overfitting risk.

## Conclusion

The **Santander Customer Satisfaction** prediction task is a complex machine learning problem, requiring careful attention to imbalanced data, thoughtful feature selection, and rigorous model evaluation. By addressing these challenges, the goal is to develop a model that generalizes well to unseen data and reliably predicts both satisfied and unsatisfied customers.
